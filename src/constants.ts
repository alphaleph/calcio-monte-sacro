·   further copies of the same information.

Calcio Monte Sacro may refuse, restrict or defer the provision of information where the Companies have the right to do so under current data protection legislation.

OUR APPROACH TO DATA SECURITY

We want you to feel confident about using the Calcio Monte Sacro Platforms. Therefore, the Companies define and implement the reasonable technical and organisational measures necessary to maintain the security of personal data, according to the nature of the personal data processed and the circumstances of the processing, with the objective of avoiding (in the realm of the possible and having regard to the state of the art) non-authorised processing or access, alteration or loss (to ensure confidentiality, integrity and availability respectively).

The Companies use industry standard SSL encryption to protect data transmissions. If You communicate with the Companies in any format other than via Calcio Monte Sacro Platforms (e.g. by e-mail), You should be aware that the secrecy of the Internet is uncertain. By sending sensitive or confidential e-mail messages or information which are not encrypted, you accept the risk of such uncertainty and possible lack of confidentiality over the Internet.

Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to the Companies. Safeguarding information to help protect You from identity theft is a great concern. Calcio Monte Sacro does not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.

ABOUT PROFILING

We do not use your personal data to make automated decisions about you that may have legal effects or otherwise significantly impact you.

The protection of personal data of children and adolescents is of particular concern to the Companies.  The Companies recommend that parents discuss the use of the Internet and the provision of personal data on websites with their children before allowing minors between fourteen (14) and sixteen (16) to register.

Calcio Monte Sacro will not knowingly collect personal data from or about children under fourteen (14). If a parent or legal guardian becomes aware that his or her child under fourteen (14) has registered as a user without their consent, he or she should delete the relevant account or if this is not possible, inform the Companies immediately. If the Companies become aware that a child under fourteen (14) has registered as a user, their access as a user will immediately be denied and their account deleted as quickly as possible (including all personal data associated with that account).

If you believe that the Companies might have any personal data from or about a child under thirteen (13), please notify the Companies in writing by email to calciomontesacro@gmail.com.
